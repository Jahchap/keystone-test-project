# keystone-test-project

A KeystoneJS Project with various configurations for development and testing purposes

If you are using Node v6.3 or higher and running the test project with `npm link keystone` for development, you may want to check out the `--preserve-symlinks` option to work around missing module errors - see the [node docs](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_preserve_symlinks). Otherwise you will need to install some packages (including `pug`) in your linked `keystone` project.

**Note: This project requires Node.js v4.x or newer**
